# ADR: OpenAB PR Review Loop

**Status:** Amended  
**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Author:** chaodu-agent

## Context

OpenAB's PR review workflow currently relies on manual triggers — a human @mentions the review bot in Discord to initiate a review. This works well for ad-hoc reviews but does not scale for repositories with frequent PR activity. Maintainers want automated PR reviews that:

1. Trigger automatically when a PR is opened or updated
2. Show review status as a commit status (🟡 pending → ✅/❌ complete)
3. Preserve the full review process in a Discord thread for auditability
4. Post a single aggregated comment on the PR (hiding previous comments)
5. Work with the existing OpenAB agent running on ECS Fargate (long-lived)

The agent should not need to be ephemeral — it stays running and receives review requests like any other Discord message.

## Decision

Use a **GitHub Action → Discord Webhook → OpenAB (ECS)** architecture with GitHub Commit Status API for check status feedback.

### Why Commit Status API (not Check Runs)

Check Runs API requires a GitHub App with `checks:write` permission. Commit Status API works with a standard PAT or fine-grained token (`commit statuses: write`), which the agent already has via `gh` CLI auth. This avoids creating an additional GitHub App solely for status reporting.

### Why Discord Webhook

- Simplest setup — only one secret (webhook URL), no Bot Token management
- Webhook messages posted to a channel will trigger OpenAB's existing message pipeline via @mention
- OpenAB auto-creates a thread for the conversation (existing behavior)

### Configuration Prerequisites

Discord webhook messages are flagged `author.bot == true` at the API level. OpenAB's Discord adapter defaults to `allow_bot_messages: "off"`, which silently drops bot messages. For this automation to work, the deployment **must** configure one of:

1. Set `allow_bot_messages: "mentions"` — allows bot messages that @mention the agent
2. Add the webhook's author ID to `trusted_bot_ids`

These settings are configured in the OpenAB ECS task definition's environment variables or the agent's runtime configuration file.

**Example (ECS environment variable):**
```
DISCORD_ALLOW_BOT_MESSAGES=mentions
```

**Example (config.toml):**
```toml
[discord]
allow_bot_messages = "mentions"
```

Without this, the webhook @mention will be ignored and reviews will never trigger.

## Amendment: Reactive → Scheduled Polling (2026-06-18)

### Problem with Reactive Mode

The original reactive design (`pull_request_target` trigger) fires a webhook on every push. While GitHub Actions' `concurrency` group cancels in-flight runs, once a Discord webhook is delivered it cannot be recalled. This causes:

1. Rapid pushes spawn multiple concurrent agent review sessions in Discord
2. Agent callbacks race — stale reviews may overwrite fresh status
3. Wasted compute and API tokens on superseded commits

### Solution: Scheduled Polling

Replace the event-driven trigger with a `schedule` cron job that polls every 5 minutes:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: {}
```

**Polling logic per open PR:**

| HEAD commit status | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| `pending` (< 30 min) | **Skip** — previous review still in progress |
| `pending` (≥ 30 min) | **Trigger** — stale, agent likely missed it |
| `success` | **Skip** — already reviewed this SHA (LGTM) |
| `failure` | **Skip** — already reviewed this SHA (CHANGES REQUESTED); new push = new SHA = auto-triggers |
| `error` / none | **Trigger** — needs review (new SHA or webhook previously failed) |

The 30-minute stale timeout handles the case where the agent is down or missed the webhook — the status would otherwise stay `pending` indefinitely, blocking further reviews.

This guarantees **at most one in-flight review per PR** at any time, regardless of push frequency.

### Trade-offs vs Reactive Mode

| Aspect | Reactive (old) | Scheduled (new) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Latency | Immediate on push | Up to 5 min (best-effort; may lag under GH load) |
| Duplicate reviews | Possible (webhook already sent) | Extremely unlikely (skip if pending; narrow race only) |
| GitHub Actions minutes | Per-push (many short runs) | Fixed (one run per 5 min) |
| Complexity | Simple trigger | Polling + state check logic |

### Why This Is Acceptable

- 5-minute latency is fine for code review (not user-facing)
- Eliminates duplicate-review bugs without agent-side dedup (agent SHA validation remains as belt-and-suspenders for narrow race)
- `workflow_dispatch` allows manual trigger for urgent reviews
- Reduces GitHub Actions billing (one run covers all PRs)
- **Cron caveat:** GitHub Actions `schedule` is best-effort — actual interval may be 5–25 min during platform congestion. This is acceptable since review latency is not user-facing.

### Stale Timeout Rationale (30 minutes)

The 30-min threshold is based on observed review completion times: typical reviews finish in 5–15 minutes (LLM processing + GitHub API calls). A legitimate review exceeding 30 min is rare (only very large PRs with many files). If re-triggered, the agent validates HEAD SHA and will skip if the original session is still active — so a false stale trigger is harmless.

### Fork PRs & `safe-to-review` in Scheduled Mode

The scheduled poller runs on `schedule` events (base repo context), so it has full access to secrets. The `safe-to-review` label bypass is preserved in the jq filter — PRs with untrusted `author_association` are included if the label is present. Fork PRs are handled the same as before: the poller can set statuses and fire webhooks for any open PR regardless of source, since it operates in the base repo context.

## Review Loop (Auto-Fix Cycle)

The architecture supports a closed-loop review cycle:

                             │  status:   │    │ Auto-fix   │ │

                                              (re-triggers Action)
```

By default, the agent **only reviews and reports findings** — it does not push fixes automatically. The auto-fix loop is only activated when a human (maintainer) explicitly requests it (e.g. "fix and push" or option 4️⃣ in the post-review menu).

When explicitly requested:

1. Agent fixes the code directly on the PR branch
2. Commits and pushes the fix
3. The new SHA has no status → next poll cycle triggers a new review
4. Repeat until LGTM or max iterations reached

### Safeguards

- **Max iterations** — agent enforces a soft cap (3 cycles per auto-fix request) to prevent runaway fixes within a single session. The workflow's circuit breaker (30 cycles) is a hard cap across the entire PR lifetime, catching edge cases where the agent cap is bypassed (e.g. multiple maintainer requests).
- **Human-only issues** — if findings require design decisions or are ambiguous, the agent requests human input instead of auto-fixing
- **Commit attribution** — auto-fix commits are authored by `chaodu-agent` with a clear prefix (e.g. `fix(review):`) so the loop is auditable

### When Auto-Fix Is Skipped

- Any 🔴 Critical finding (correctness, security) — requires human judgment
- Ambiguous 🟡 findings where multiple valid solutions exist
- Maintainer explicitly opts out of auto-fix for the PR

## Dedup & Performance

The scheduled polling model inherently deduplicates reviews:

### Primary Dedup: Status-Based Gating

The poller checks HEAD commit status before triggering. If status is `pending`, the PR is skipped — guaranteeing at most one in-flight review per PR at any time. Rapid pushes between polls simply update HEAD; only the latest SHA is reviewed on next poll.

### Agent-Side SHA Validation (Belt-and-Suspenders)

Even with polling, a narrow race is possible (push arrives between status check and webhook delivery). The agent still validates:

1. Agent extracts `__commit: <SHA>__` from the trigger message
2. Agent queries current PR HEAD: `gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid`
3. If request SHA ≠ HEAD → skip review, respond "Superseded by newer commit"
4. If request SHA = HEAD → proceed with normal review

This prevents wasting API tokens and reviewer compute on commits that are no longer relevant.

### Cost Impact

Without dedup, N rapid pushes could trigger N full reviews (~5 LLM calls each for angle-based delegation). With both layers active, at most 1 review runs per push burst.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: GitHub Action Workflow

> **Canonical source:** [`.github/workflows/pr-bot-review.yml`](../../.github/workflows/pr-bot-review.yml)
>
> Refer to the workflow file for the current implementation. Key design points:

- **Trigger:** `schedule` (cron `*/5 * * * *`) + `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs
- **Polling logic:** iterates all open PRs, checks HEAD commit status, skips if `pending` (fresh), `success`, or `failure`
- **Guard condition:** skips drafts, untrusted authors, and PRs with `review-limit-reached` label
- **Steps:** poll open PRs → for each eligible PR: circuit breaker check → set pending status → trigger Discord webhook → error fallback on failure

### Phase 2: Agent Callback (Status Update)

After the agent posts the final PR comment, update the commit status (using the comment's `html_url` from the API response as `target_url` so "Details" links directly to the review):

```bash
# LGTM
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/SHA \
  -f state="success" \
  -f context="OpenAB PR Review" \
  -f description="LGTM ✅" \
  -f target_url="<comment_html_url>"

# Changes Requested
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/SHA \
  -f state="failure" \
  -f context="OpenAB PR Review" \
  -f description="Changes Requested ⚠️" \
  -f target_url="<comment_html_url>"
```

### Phase 3: Branch Protection

Add `OpenAB PR Review` as a required status check in branch protection rules. This enforces that PRs cannot merge until the review completes successfully.

**Setup:** Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → Edit `main` → Require status checks to pass before merging → Add `OpenAB PR Review` to the required checks list.

## Token & Permissions

| Secret | Purpose | Minimum Permission |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Actions) | Set pending status + circuit breaker label | `statuses: write` + `issues: write` |
| `OAB_REVIEW_ACTION_WEBHOOK` | Post review request to Discord channel | Webhook URL (channel-scoped) |
| Agent's `gh` auth (PAT) | Post comment + update status + push auto-fix | `repo` (classic) or `contents: write` + `pull_requests: write` + `commit statuses: write` (fine-grained) |

### GitHub Actions Secrets Setup

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `OAB_REVIEW_ACTION_WEBHOOK` | Discord channel webhook URL (Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) |
| `OAB_REVIEW_ACTION_BOT_UID` | Discord user ID of the bot to @mention (e.g. the review agent's UID) |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by Actions — no manual setup needed.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fully automated — no manual @mention needed for PR reviews
- PR Checks tab shows live review status (🟡 → ✅/❌)
- Can enforce review via branch protection rules
- Discord thread preserves full review audit trail (OpenAB auto-creates threads)
- No architectural changes to OpenAB — agent receives messages normally
- Fire-and-forget Action — no runner time wasted waiting for review
- Minimal secrets — only one webhook URL needed in GitHub Secrets

**Negative:**
- Up to 5-min latency before review starts (GitHub cron is best-effort, may lag further under load)
- If OpenAB agent is down, status stays "pending" until stale timeout re-triggers (30 min)
- Webhook messages lack user identity — OpenAB must allow webhook-originated messages
- Fork PRs: `OAB_REVIEW_ACTION_WEBHOOK` and `OAB_REVIEW_ACTION_BOT_UID` secrets are not available to workflows triggered by fork PRs (GitHub security policy). The webhook step will fail, and since fork PRs receive a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the error fallback **cannot** write commit statuses either — the workflow will fail silently with no status update. Fork PRs can still be reviewed manually via Discord @mention. Note: the `safe-to-review` label does **not** grant secrets access to fork PRs — it only bypasses the `author_association` gate for same-repo PRs.

**Mitigations:**
- Filter: skip draft PRs and untrusted authors — only `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`, and `CONTRIBUTOR` (returning contributor with merged PR) trigger automatic review. First-time contributors and unknown authors are skipped; maintainers can add `safe-to-review` label or manually @mention the agent.
- Dedup: status-based gating — `pending` (fresh) and `failure`/`success` skip review. Only new SHAs with no status or stale `pending` (>30 min) trigger.
- Concurrency: workflow-level `concurrency` group prevents overlapping cron runs from racing.
- Error fallback: webhook failure marks status as "error", which will be retried on next poll cycle.
- Timeout: stale `pending` >30 min is treated as agent-down and re-triggered automatically.

## Safeguards

### Trusted Contributor Filter

The workflow uses GitHub's `author_association` field to gate automatic reviews. Only PRs from trusted authors trigger the review pipeline:

| `author_association` | Auto-review? | Meaning |
|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| `OWNER` | ✅ | Repository owner |
| `MEMBER` | ✅ | Organization member |
| `COLLABORATOR` | ✅ | Explicitly granted write access |
| `CONTRIBUTOR` | ✅ | Has previously merged a PR |
| `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` | ❌ | First PR to this repo |
| `NONE` | ❌ | No prior relationship |

**Why:** Prevents token waste and prompt-injection risk from untrusted PR diffs being fed into agent context. Maintainers can still manually @mention the agent to review skipped PRs after visual inspection.

### Label Override: `safe-to-review`

Maintainers can add the `safe-to-review` label to any PR to bypass the `author_association` check. This triggers the workflow via the `labeled` event, allowing untrusted contributors' PRs to be reviewed automatically after a maintainer has visually confirmed the PR is safe.

**Important:** This label only enables automatic review for **same-repo PRs**. Fork PRs lack access to repository secrets regardless of labels — adding `safe-to-review` to a fork PR will not trigger automation. Fork PRs must be reviewed manually via Discord @mention.

**Note:** The `labeled` event is filtered — only `safe-to-review` and `auto-fix` labels trigger the workflow. Other labels (e.g. `documentation`, `bug`) are ignored to avoid unnecessary review runs.

### Auto-Fix Mode: `auto-fix`

When the `auto-fix` label is present, the webhook payload includes `__mode: auto-fix__`. The agent enters an iterative loop:

1. Review PR → identify actionable findings (🔴/🟡)
2. Fix all findings → push commit
3. Re-review until LGTM or max iterations reached (agent-side cap, recommended: 3)

When the auto-fix loop completes (LGTM or cap reached), the agent removes the `auto-fix` label to prevent subsequent pushes from re-entering the fix loop.

**Constraints:**
- Only effective on same-repo branches (agent needs push access)
- Fork PRs: automation does not trigger (no secrets available); review manually via Discord @mention
- Agent must implement iteration cap to prevent infinite push→review loops

### Circuit Breaker (workflow hard cap: 30)

The workflow enforces a hard cap of 30 review cycles per PR (across all triggers over the PR's lifetime). This is distinct from the agent-side soft cap of 3 cycles per auto-fix session — the workflow cap catches edge cases where multiple auto-fix requests accumulate. On each run, it counts how many `pending` statuses with context `"OpenAB PR Review"` exist across all commits in the PR. If the count reaches 30:

1. Adds `review-limit-reached` label to the PR
2. Sets commit status to `error` with description "Circuit breaker: exceeded 30 review cycles"
3. Fails the workflow step

The `review-limit-reached` label is checked in the job `if` condition — once applied, no further review runs will trigger. A maintainer can remove the label to reset the circuit breaker if needed.
